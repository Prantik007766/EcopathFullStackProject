# Ecopath
Overview
EcoPath is a web-based application designed specifically for Indian coal mines to quantify, monitor, and reduce their carbon footprint. The platform provides a centralized system to calculate emissions from mining activities, visualize the carbon footprint, and explore actionable pathways toward carbon neutrality in alignment with India’s sustainability and Net Zero goals.

Key Features

🌍 Activity-Based Carbon Calculation:
Automatically estimates CO₂, CH₄, and other GHG emissions based on mine operations such as fuel usage, transportation, and energy consumption.

📊 Data Visualization:
Interactive dashboards and charts display total and per capita emissions, emission sources, and historical trends for transparency and decision-making.

🌱 Pathways to Neutrality:
Recommends carbon offset measures such as afforestation, renewable energy adoption, methane capture, and clean technology integration.

🏆 Carbon Credits & Reporting:
Calculates potential carbon credits and generates sustainability reports to support compliance with ESG and government standards.

Future Scope

Integration with IoT sensors for real-time emission monitoring.

AI-driven predictions for future emission trends.

Expansion to other industrial sectors beyond coal mining.
